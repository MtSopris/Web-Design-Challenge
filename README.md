# Web-Design-Challenge

In this repo is my first ever webpage that reviews weather data collected from OpenWeathermap API and utilized Matplotlib for the visualizations. The page is an exercise in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap components of web design and presentation of the data analized.
 It consists of….
Landing page - that summarizes the site and has links to the individual visualizations on each image.
Comparison page – displays all of the visualizations together and includes links to the detailed induvial visualizations through the images
Data page – this reference page displays the data used for the analysis
Plot pages – each page includes that specific analysis and the conclusions found in that analysis. These pages are accessible through image links or a dropdown menu in the navigation bar.
Lastly included is the python code for the collection of the data into the table.html.
